Quantophile is a platform for automated trading. The goal is for Quantophile to handle data downloading and handling from a database  for automated trading scripts written by the user, while also providing an interface for the trading scripts. Quantophile also has a permission system written in PHP. This is so that several users can use a single server for trading, minimizing the cost of hosting. Quantophile will have a python, as well as C++ interface. It will integrate the APIs of several brokerages to get data, or make trading calls.
